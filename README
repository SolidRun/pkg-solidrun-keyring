README for the solidrun-keyring package
===================================================

SolidRun digitally signs its Release files that are
stored on the repo.solid-build.xyz ftp-server and its mirrors with the
keys contained in this package.

Each active key is provided in a separate keyring in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
as conffiles.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
here: http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt
